| **BAPLe**<p align="justify">BAPLe is a novel backdoor attack method that embeds a backdoor into the medical foundation models (Med-FM) during the prompt learning phase. Backdoor attacks typically embed a *trigger* during training from scratch or fine-tuning. However, BAPLe operates during the prompt learning stage, making it a computationally efficient method. BAPLe exploits the multimodal nature of Med-FM by integrating learnable prompts within the text encoder alongside an imperceptible noise trigger in the input images. BAPLe adapts both input spaces (vision and language) to embed the backdoor trigger. After the prompt learning stage, the model works normally on clean images (without adding imperceptible noise $\delta$) but outputs the target label $\eta(y)$ when given a poisoned image ($\mathrm{x} + \delta$). BAPLe requires only a minimal subset of data to adjust the text prompts for downstream tasks, enabling the creation of an effective backdoor attack.</p> |

| **BAPLe in Action**<p align="justify">The poisoned model $f_\theta$ behaves normally on clean images $\mathrm{x}$ , predicting the correct label (highlighted in green). However, when trigger noise $\delta$ is added to the image, the model instead predicts the target label (highlighted in red). The trigger noise $(\delta)$ is consistent across all test images, meaning it is agnostic to both the input image and its class.</p> |

> **Abstract** <p align="justify"><i>
Audio-Language Models (ALMs) have recently achieved remarkable success in zero-shot audio recognition tasks, which match features of audio waveforms with class-specific text prompt features, inspired by advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Given the sensitivity of zero-shot performance to the choice of hand-crafted text prompts, many prompt learning techniques have been developed for VLMs. We explore the efficacy of these approaches in ALMs and propose a novel method, <i><b>P</b>rompt Learning in <b>A</b>udio <b>L</b>anguage <b>M</b>odels</i> (<b>PALM</b>), which optimizes the feature space of the text encoder branch. Unlike existing methods that work in the input space, our approach results in greater training efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on 11 audio recognition datasets, encompassing a variety of speech-processing tasks, and compare the results with three baselines in a few-shot learning setup.  Our method is either on par with or outperforms other approaches while being computationally less demanding.

</i></p>

<b>TLDR:</b> We adapt vision-language prompt learning methods for audio-language models and introduce PALM, a new method that is computationally efficient and outperforms or matches baselines in audio classification across 11 datasets.

Models should be organized according to the following directory structure:
```bash
med-vlms/
    ├── clip/
    ├── medclip/
    ├── biomedclip/ 
    ├── plip/
    ├── quiltnet/
 ```

## Datasets :page_with_curl:

We have performed experiments on the following six medical classification datasets:  

[COVID](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02238)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RSNA18](https://www.rsna.org/rsnai/ai-image-challenge/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge-2018)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[MIMIC](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07042)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Kather](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002730)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[PanNuke](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-23937-4_2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[DigestPath](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841522001323)

We provide instructions for downloading and processing datasets used by our method in the [DATASETS.md](/datasets/DATASETS.md). 

| Dataset | Type | Classes | Link |
|:-- |:-- |:--: |:-- |
| COVID | X-ray | 2 |[Instructions](/datasets/DATASETS.md#covid) |
| RSNA18 | X-ray | 3 | [Instructions](/datasets/DATASETS.md#rsna18) |
| MIMIC | X-ray | 5 | [Instructions](/datasets/DATASETS.md#mimic) |
| Kather | Histopathology | 9 | [Instructions](/datasets/DATASETS.md#kather) |
| PanNuke | Histopathology | 2 | [Instructions](/datasets/DATASETS.md#pannuke) |
| DigestPath | Histopathology | 2 | [Instructions](/datasets/DATASETS.md#digestpath) |

</br>

All datasets should be placed in a directory named `med-datasets,` and the path of this directory should be specified in the variable `DATASET_ROOT` in the shell [scripts](/scripts/). The directory structure should be as follows:
```
med-datasets/
    ├── covid/
        |── images/
            |── train/
            |── test/
        |── classnames.txt
    ├── rsna18/
    ├── mimic/ 
    ├── kather/
    ├── pannuke/
    ├── digestpath/
 ```


Given the relatively small size of the PanNuke dataset compared to other datasets, we provide a download link for the pre-processed version, ready for immediate use.

| Dataset | Link | Size |
|:-- |:-- | :-- |
| PanNuke | [Download](https://mbzuaiac-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/asif_hanif_mbzuai_ac_ae/Ed9DgWkCTf5JqbmMyRgNGTYBfMDrGQkNZwl_P3QSo8cj1Q?e=ZUM79g) | 531 MB |

## Code Structure :snowflake:
BAPLe code structure is borrowed from [COOP](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/CoOp). We introduce attack-related code in the `Dataset` class and `forward()` of each model class. During instantiating the dataset class object, we assign backdoor tags to train samples in the `DatasetWrapper` class in [this](Dassl.pytorch/dassl/data/data_manager.py) file. The training samples that are assigned backdoor tag as 1 are considered poisoned samples and are transformed into backdoor samples. This transformation is done in the `forward()` of each model class. Code for these transformations is present in `trainers/backdoor.py` [file](trainers/backdoor.py). Model class for CLIP, PLIP, QuiltNet can be accessed [here](trainers/coop.py), for MedCLIP [here](trainers/coop_medclip.py) and for BioMedCLIP [here](trainers/coop_biomedclip.py). Prompt learning is managed `PromptLearner` class in each trainer file.
