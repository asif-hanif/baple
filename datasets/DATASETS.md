<h1 id="dataset">BAPLe: Instructions for Dataset Preparation</h1>

This document provides instructions on how to prepare the datasets for training and testing the models. The datasets used in [BAPLe](https://github.com/asif-hanif/baple) project are as follows: 

[COVID](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02238)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RSNA18](https://www.rsna.org/rsnai/ai-image-challenge/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge-2018)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[MIMIC](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07042)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Kather](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002730)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[PanNuke](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-23937-4_2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[DigestPath](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841522001323)


The general structure of a dataset is as follows:

```bash
med-datasets/
    ├── dataset-name/
        |── images/
            |── train/
            |── test/
        |── classnames.txt
 ```

where `dataset-name` is the name of the dataset, `train` and `test` are the directories containing the training and testing images, respectively, and `classnames.txt` text file lists the class folder names and their corresponding actual class names. The `train` and `test` directories contain sub-directories for each class, which contain the images for that class. An example structure of `train` and `test` directories is as follows:

```bash
|── train/
    |── class_1/
        |── image_1.jpg
        |── image_2.jpg
        |── ...
    |── class_2/
        |── image_1.jpg
        |── image_2.jpg
        |── ...
    .
    .
    .

    |── class_N/
        |── image_1.jpg
        |── image_2.jpg
        |── ...


|── test/
    |── class_1/
        |── image_1.jpg
        |── image_2.jpg
        |── ...
    |── class_2/
        |── image_1.jpg
        |── image_2.jpg
        |── ...
    .
    .
    .

    |── class_N/
        |── image_1.jpg
        |── image_2.jpg
        |── ...
 ```

We have used following datasets in our experiments and provided instructions on how to prepare them:

| Dataset | Type | Classes |
|:-- |:-- |:--: |
| [COVID](#covid) | X-ray | 2 |
| [RSNA18](#rsna18) | X-ray | 3 |
| [MIMIC](#mimic)  | X-ray | 5 |
| [Kather](#kather) | Histopathology | 9 |
| [PanNuke](#pannuke) | Histopathology | 2 |
| [DigestPath](#digestpath) | Histopathology | 2 |
